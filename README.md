# RNA-seq Pipeline (QC → Alignment → Quantification → DE)

This repo demonstrates a minimal, reproducible RNA-seq pipeline suitable for PhD/demo projects.  
It covers:

- **QC** with FastQC  
- **Alignment** with HISAT2  
- **Quantification** with featureCounts  
- **Differential expression** with DESeq2  

**Status:** setting up environment & data.  
**Next:** download a small public dataset (GEO/SRA), run QC and alignment, push results.
